This project was an opportunity for me to practice development on React, using it to create a voluminous web application.

The main goal was not so much to get a finished product, but to study React in action on the example of a complex project, to work out the architecture and basic approaches.

Thanks to this practice, I was able to better understand the structuring of React code, the interaction of components, and the organization of the application state.

This helped me improve my web development skills using React.

In the future, based on the experience gained, I plan to create more complex and optimized applications with even more complex business logic.

Thank you for your help in improving the description! It is very useful to refine it taking into account feedback.
